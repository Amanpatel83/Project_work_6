## Approach
I customized the BigCommerce Cornerstone Light theme to display product color swatches on the product listing pages (category pages). The following files were modified:
- `category.html`
- `product-card.html`
- `assets/css/styles.css`

## Template Files Modified
- **category.html**: Modified to loop through product options and display color swatches.
- **product-card.html**: Added functionality to render color swatches for each product.
- **styles.css**: Added CSS styles for the swatches.
